I am an sophomore at Colgate University studying Applied Mathematics and Physics. I am interested in studying applications of mathematics in finance. I have a strong background in computer science and computational methods used in solving or simulating complex systems.

I was an intern in the Corporate Treasury group at Pfizer in the summer of 2024, where I learned about the financial markets through internal and external meetings, weekly teaching sessions, and working closely with team members on various projects.
